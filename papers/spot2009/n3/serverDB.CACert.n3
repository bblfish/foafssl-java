        this is the handle the server has on the client that made the
        connection. It could/should be a blank node, but it is easier for 
        testing purposes to make it a local URL. 
        
        The SSL handshake means that the server knows the public key of the
        end user. Here we made the public key a literal 42, just because that
        simplifies things. Of course it is a public key described using the
        cert ontology.
