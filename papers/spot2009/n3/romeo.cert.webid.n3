   We are not putting the literal here because it would require
   writing a parser for it. What interests us is that it has a signature
   and that we know the semantics for it. and that we have its signature.
  ( of course without that literal it is impossible to verify the signature
    so we will be asserting it as a fact )

   Note the DN certifiying the certificate can be anyone. It also can
   have a WebID of course.
